## Crafting User Experiences

### Design Philosophy

Using the versatile tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), I sculpted a user-friendly interface that prioritizes simplicity and clarity. By employing ample white space and a muted color palette, I aimed to deliver an experience that's both visually soothing and effortlessly navigable. Upholding the principles of inclusively, I ensured adherence to top-notch web accessibility standards. Leveraging [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), I brought my design vision to life, complemented by icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev).

### Development Mastery

Harnessing the power of **Next.js 14**, I integrated cutting-edge features to enhance performance and functionality:

- [Automatic Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
- [Server Action](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/server-action)
- [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/server-components)
- [File System Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)

## Markdown Rendering

All content is meticulously crafted in markdown and seamlessly rendered during the build process. Employing [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) and [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype), I ensure a smooth conversion of markdown to HTML. Styles are meticulously applied using [Tailwind CSS Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) and [prose](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/prose).

## APIs Integration

### GitHub API Integration and Chart.js

To showcase my open-sourc contributions, I integrated the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to dynamically fetch and display my GitHub information and repositories by using [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/). This ensures that my GitHub contributions are always up-to-date and accurately reflected on my website.

I also integrated [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display my GitHub contributions in a visually appealing way. This ensures that my GitHub contributions are always up-to-date and accurately reflected on my website.

### WakaTime Integration

To showcase my coding activity, I integrated the [WakaTime API](https://wakatime.com/developers) to dynamically fetch and display my coding activity by using [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/). This ensures that my coding activity is always up-to-date and accurately reflected on my website.

### Spotify Integration

To showcase my music taste, I integrated the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to dynamically fetch and display my currently playing track. This ensures that my music taste is always up-to-date and accurately reflected on my website.

## Deployment

The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), ensuring a seamless and secure user experience. Leveraging the power of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), I crafted a dynamic and responsive website that's optimized for performance and accessibility. By integrating [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) and [Vercel Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights), I can monitor and enhance the website's performance in real-time. Leveraging the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download), updates and enhancements are effortlessly pushed live, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Speed Insights

In building this website, I really paid attention to all aspects related to performance and SEO. Therefore, I'll display the website performance report on this page, and it will always be updated periodically. The performance report is generated using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights).
