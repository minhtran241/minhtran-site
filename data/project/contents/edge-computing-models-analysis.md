## Edge Computing Models for IoT Analytics

This project contains a collection of edge computing models for IoT analytics. The models are designed to help organizations understand the benefits of edge computing and how it can be used to process data from IoT devices more efficiently. Each model provides an overview of the architecture, advantages, and use cases for edge computing in IoT analytics.

## Models

### Edge Computing with Multiple Edge Servers

#### Overview

This model leverages multiple edge servers connected to the cloud. The edge servers handle data processing from IoT devices, sending processed results to the cloud for further analysis. This setup is ideal for scenarios requiring low latency and when the cloud cannot manage the large volume of data generated by IoT devices. Geographically distributed edge servers reduce latency and enhance reliability.

## Usage

### Requirements

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with Raspbian OS installed
- [SocketIO](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and follow the template created in the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/minhtran241/edge-computing-models/blob/main/.env.example) file.

```bash
EDGE_TARGET=
NUM_IOT_TARGETS=
IOT_TARGET_1=
IOT_TARGET_2=
IOT_TARGET_3=
```

> The `NUM_IOT_TARGETS` variable is used to specify the number of server nodes in the edge computing network which receive data/results from the IoT devices. The `IOT_TARGET_1`, `IOT_TARGET_2`, `IOT_TARGET_3` variables are used to specify the IP addresses of the those server nodes. Depending on the model architecture, you may need to update the number of IoT devices and target server variables.

### Run the code

To run the code, you need to start the servers in the following order:

1. Start the cloud server
2. Start the edge servers
3. Start the IoT devices

For all the servers, you can run the following command:

```bash
python trigger.py
```

This will require your input to specify the following parameters:

- The role of the device (IoT device, edge server or cloud)
  - Valid roles: `iot`, `edge`, `cloud`
- The device ID
- The algorithm code [See the list of available algorithms](#available-algorithms)
- The size of the data
- Number of iterations
- The model architecture [See the enum `ModelArch` in the [`enums.py`](https://github.com/minhtran241/edge-computing-models/blob/main/models/enums.py) file]

#### Input format

```bash
================
Available roles:
iot <id> <algo_code> <size_option> <iterations>
edge <id>
cloud <id>
Set up device parameters: ...
================
```

```bash
Set up model architecture ['IOT', 'EDGE', 'CLOUD']: ...
```

### Available algorithms

1. Smith-Waterman
   - **Code**: `sw`
   - **Description**: A dynamic programming algorithm for sequence alignment

2. Sentiment Analysis
   - **Code**: `sa`
   - **Description**: VADER sentiment analysis algorithm for text sentiment analysis

3. Tesseract OCR
   - **Code**: `ocr`
   - **Description**: An optical character recognition algorithm for text recognition

4. YOLOv8
   - **Code**: `yolo`
   - **Description**: An object detection algorithm for image recognition

### Adding new algorithms

The helper functions for the algorithms should be placed in the [`/helpers`](https://github.com/minhtran241/edge-computing-models/tree/main/helpers) module. For each algorithm, you need at least two functions: `preprocess` and `process`.

- The `preprocess` function is used to prepare the input data for the algorithm in the IoT device. This function should take the `data_dir` as input and return the processed data.
- The `process` function is used to run the algorithm on the input data and return the result in the edge server. This function should take the `data` as input and return the result. The signature of the function should be as follows:

```python
from typing import Any

def process_name(data: Any) -> Any:
 """
 Run the algorithm on the input data and return the result.

 Args:
  data (str): The input data to process.

 Returns:
  str: The result of the algorithm.
 """
 pass
```

- Update the `DATA_CONFIG` dictionary in the [`config.py`](https://github.com/minhtran241/edge-computing-models/blob/main/config.py) file to include the new algorithm.

- Update the `Algorithm` enum in the [`enums.py`](https://github.com/minhtran241/edge-computing-models/blob/main/models/enums.py) file to include the new algorithm.
